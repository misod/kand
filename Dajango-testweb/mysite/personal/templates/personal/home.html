  <div class="col-md-5"><h4>Digital Flylogs</h4>
    <p>By using an already existing application called Open Glider Network,
       digitized flight logs will be created. Open Glider Network's system
       allows collection of data from airplanes that have FLARM installed. FLARM,
        short for Flight Alarm, is a new safety precaution used to prevent collision
         between aircraft. It also registers the aircraftsâ€™ speed, altitude and position.
          This project focuses on the use of collected data from the FLARM system to create
          digitized flight logs.This will allow them to investigate if the system has the same
           safety aspects as the analog system. The human error concerning the logs will also be minimized,
            should this system be used.</p>

      <p> We are four students that have worked on this site for our bachelor exam in Information Technology at Uppsala University.
        The purpose of this website was to help a local glider club to streamline their organization and reduce the paperwork whit
        flightlogs and make a backup if the human error would occur.</div>
